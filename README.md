2. Services - This component provides business logic to the application.
3. Repository - This component interacts with the database.
4. Module - This component is responsible for the design of the schema.

## Data Structure

- ArrayList

## brief description of each of the components in the context of the code:

### Controller
The controller is responsible for handling incoming requests and returning appropriate responses. In the code, it have a JobController which handles requests related to the user entity. It has methods such as GetAllJob,AddJob,DeleteJob,GetJobByTitle,GetJobByDescription,jobtypeId. These methods use the UserService to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the user data.

These methods perform validation on the input data and delegate database operations to the UserRepository.

### Repository
